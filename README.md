//  My Final Project for fundamentals of computing (fall 2015) is a recreation of level 1 of the 1980 Atari VCS Video Game "Adventure" by Warren Robinett
// In Adventure, you play as a nameless hero (the square) on a quest to retrieve the holy grail and
// return it to your castle (the gold castle).  In order to succede in your quest, you must fight off the
// dragons, find the key to the enemy castle, and navigate the labryth in order to find the chalice.
// the pixel art has been recreated as accuratey  as possible, which means that, just like in the original
// game, the dragon looks like a duck/seahorse, and the sword looks like an arrow. you use the WASD keys
// to move, and use the space bar to drop the item you are holding on to.  press the "p" key to quit.

// I choose this game becuase it is probably my favorite retro video game, and I felt like creating the game was withing my programming scope.  Also, Adventure is credited with being the first Action Adventure video game, and also the first easter egg in a video game.  Unfortunately, in this version, the easter egg has not been implemented.  after working on it, I realsied that the game was in my scope, but it was very difficult.
